It's been a while since I had some time to dedicate to Revapi.
Now that I got a few moments to spare, I was finally able to spend
a few moments on Revapi and at long last release the new versions
of the components.

Thanks to Alan Zimmer for improving the stability of the Java analysis
and for a big speed up in DifferenceTransforms that are no longer required
to use regular expressions for difference code comparisons.

In related news, the Revapi gradle plugin has left its original home in 
Palantir and landed in the revapi organization thanks to the efforts of
Ajantha Bhat and others last year.

Apart from that I am trying to keep the build and dependencies more or less
up-to-date.

I intend to spend a little bit more time on Revapi trying to make it easier
to move the Java analyzer past Java 8 which in my eyes is the last obstacle
before releasing the first GA version of Revapi.
