This is again a tiny release of `revapi-java:0.28.4` that adds a configuration property to the new vararg overload
check to ignore unchanged methods. This makes it easier for libraries with already released problematic methods
to just not consider these as problems and not have to ignore/document them in the API changes.

Thanks to Thomas Mortagne for pointing out this fact.
